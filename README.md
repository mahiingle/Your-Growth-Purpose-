# Your-Growth-Purpose
Great! Once you've pasted your project code on GitHub, here’s what you need to do step-by-step to host your app for free using Vercel:


---

✅ STEP-BY-STEP: HOST REACT APP FREE VIA VERCEL

🌐 1. Create a GitHub Repository

If not already done:

Go to https://github.com

Click “New” > Give it a name (e.g., the-growth-purpose)

Keep it public or private (both work with Vercel)

Click “Create repository”



---

🧑‍💻 2. Upload Your Code

Either clone it using Git or directly upload files from your system.

Ensure your folder includes:

package.json

src/ folder with the React app

public/ folder

.gitignore (optional but recommended)

tailwind.config.js (if using TailwindCSS)

postcss.config.js

index.html, index.js, etc.




---

🚀 3. Go to Vercel

Visit: https://vercel.com

Sign up (or log in) with your GitHub account



---

🔁 4. Connect GitHub Repository to Vercel

After login, click “New Project”

Vercel will show a list of your GitHub repos

Click on your project repo (e.g., the-growth-purpose)

Select the framework as React

Leave all default settings

Click “Deploy”



---

🎉 5. Done! Your App is Live

Vercel will build and deploy the app

After a few seconds, your live URL will be ready (e.g., https://the-growth-purpose.vercel.app)



---

🔁 Future Edits

When you change anything in your GitHub code:

Vercel will auto-update your site

No need to redeploy manually



---

✅ Optional: Custom Domain

In Vercel, you can add a free .vercel.app domain or your own .com if you have one.
